        "description": "For any currency pair, Nuo uses best price provided by decentralised exchanges (Pd) and hard-fences it using volume weighted average price aggregated over price feeds from centralised exchanges (Pc).\nCurrently Nuo uses Kyber and Uniswap as decentralised partner exchanges. Among centralised exchanges, Nuo tracks price and volume across all major cexes with >50 total cexes added already.\nAt any time, for any currency pair, Pd = Best Price across partner decentralised exchanges Pc = TimeDecaySum( Sum( VolumeOfCex * PriceByCex ) / TotalVolumeAcrossAllCexes )\nVolumeOfCex, PriceByCex and TotalVolumeAcrossAllCexes use clustering techniques to remove anomalies in price/volume and ignore exchanges with poor pricing.\nTimeDecaySum is built to reduce effect of a high volume exchange going offline for a while by reducing the weight of the price obtained from a cex based on the duration when the last trade was recorded from it.\nFor any currency pair, Nuo hard-fencing ensures the following holds true: lower_fence * Pc < Pd < upper_fence * Pc\nCurrently, fencing percentage is placed at 10% system-wide. Hence, lower_fence = 0.9 and upper_fence = 1.1. We can expect a tighter fence as dexes get more efficient and liquid in future\nAt any point in time, if the above condition does not hold true, the exchange market is paused and resumed again when the condition becomes true. This is done to prevent any unwanted liquidations from happening on the platform due to price manipulations or flash crashes across our partner dexes.\nThere are plans to potentially integrate Chainlink in a future version.",

Source price differs to the most recently submitted price by more than the defined amount (currently 1%)\n2. Last price update was more than 6 hours ago.\nPrice updates are written to the blockchain via price feed contracts which are deployed and owned by feed operators. Price feed contracts which have been whitelisted by the medianizer are able to forward their prices for inclusion in the medianized price.\nThe medianizer is the smart contract which provides Makers trusted reference price.\nIt maintains a whitelist of price feed contracts which are allowed to post price updates and a record of recent prices supplied by each address. Every time a new price update is received the median of all feed prices is re-computed and the medianized value is updated.\nPermissions:\nThe adding and removal of whitelisted price feed addresses is controlled via governance, as is the setting of the min parameter - the minimum number of valid feeds required in order for the medianized value to be considered valid.\nv2 introduces several new proposals:\n1. Add a set of DeFi partners as Feeds\n2. An Oracle Team Mandate to create an Oracle Team role. The mandate will empower MKR Governance to appoint Oracle Team(s) to perform certain tasks on their behalf.\n3.
